# Ukesoppgave 1.8
 Exercise 8 (Frequency Tree) We want to use a binary search tree to analyze the play Vildanden 
 from Henrik Ibsen. First read all the words which are separated by, e.g. “;”, “?”, etc, 
 from the file and insert them into an initially binary search tree. All the words which are different from upper case and 
 lower case are considered to be the same. Each node in the tree is corresponding to a unique word in the file. Each node should remember the frequency of the corresponding word appear in the play.
- Create a separate frequency tree which is sorted on the frequency of each word.
- Write a sorted list of the N most frequently used words (e.g. N = 20).
- Write a list of all words having frequency between X and Y (which may be equal).
- Calculate the depth of the left and right subtrees for both the binary search tree and the frequency tree.
- Are the left and right subtrees balanced? If not, propose a way to make the tree more balanced, and implement and test the proposal.
